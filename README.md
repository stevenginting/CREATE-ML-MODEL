# CREATE-ML-MODEL
ðŸ¤– Create Machine Learning Models
This project is a comprehensive collection of machine learning (ML) model creation processes, ranging from basic algorithms like Linear Regression to more complex models such as Deep Neural Networks.

ðŸ“Œ Project Description
The purpose of this project is to explore and implement various machine learning models for both classification and regression tasks. Each model follows a structured pipelineâ€”from loading and cleaning data, to training, evaluation, and saving the final trained model.

The goal is to better understand how different models perform under different scenarios and datasets.

ðŸ’¡ Models Covered
This repository includes implementations of several popular machine learning algorithms, including:

Linear Regression

Logistic Regression

Decision Trees

Random Forest Classifier

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

Support Vector Machines (SVM)

Naive Bayes

Gradient Boosting

Neural Networks (using TensorFlow/Keras)

Deep Learning (ANN/CNN for classification tasks)
